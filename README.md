Code accompanying the paper "Deep Learning in Surgery - Assessing The Utility of Deep Neural Networks in Predicting Postoperative Surgical Complications: A Retrospective Study"

We have published five Jupyter notebooks: one for data preprocessing, one for each of the three models, and one for calculating personalized risk predictions. 
For privacy- and security reasons, we have chosen not to publish the identification numbers of the cases in our test set.
